Part 1 - Abstract Scene using Particles and Noise
Campfire Scene

Noise is used to separate the axes for the fire particle to create the
wisps of flames coming from the fire. The leaf particles uses noise to alter the way they fall.
Noise is also used for the height map of the terrain.

Trees are placed over the terrain and the branches of the trees cloest to the fire
bend slightly in response to audio. 

Properties that control parameters of the scene:
Ground Size Slider
Rotation Speed Slider
